The testings are conducted in our accredited laboratories, while a highly skilled team of our experts daily performs field testing of radio frequency signals.<br /><br />Based on years of experience, a system for monitoring of electromagnetic field radiation for all important frequencies - MEP has been developed.<br /><br />Insight into the monitoring results, i.e. actual radiation values, is available for local communities. In this way, interested citizens can compare actual radiation values with the levels defined in the Regulations for protection against electromagnetic fields.<br /><br />Electromagnetic spectrum monitoring is primarily important in the frequency areas used by high power transmitters, which include radio and mobile transmitters.",

The lack of information leads to public concern for the health and safety of the environment in which they are located. Although currently available electromagnetic field estimation programs can show the simulation of electromagnetic dispersion, experience shows that systems behave differently according to the location, position and height, and depending on whether they are in urban or non-urban areas. In addition, occasional measurements of electromagnetic fields can give an incomplete picture of the current state.",

The system consists of an isotropic antenna for measuring all 3 axes, spectrum analyzer, GSM modems and a software application that receives data and displays it in a user – friendly form. The measurement station, through the spectral analyzer and antenna, measures and processes the level of electromagnetic fields in predefined frequency ranges in real time. The result is the sum of electromagnetic fields across all frequency bands (FM, TV, TETRA, GSM, DCS, UMTS, WIFI ...). The MEP system updates the measuring data every hour.",

Carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen monoxide and ozone affect our air, as does particulate matter (PM). Combined together, their values result in an index ranging from 0 to 100, with these effects on the general population:",
  "text.about.mep": "The monitoring of the electromagnetic spectrum is mainly important in frequency ranges used by stronger transmitters. This includes, among others, radio stations and, broadcasters of various mobile service providers which have become recently popular. Non-ionizing radiation surrounds us in every part of the planet, and at what levels the effects of radiation on living things can be identified is still unknown; this can also be well seen on the radiation value limits, which are defined in different ways and are yet to be confirmed in medical research. With this application, it is possible to see every day how much we are exposed to the influence of the electromagnetic field.",
